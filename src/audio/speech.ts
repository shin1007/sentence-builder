 * Hard cap on how long a caller will wait for an utterance to report back.
 *
 * Callers gate real game progress on these promises — the countdown only arms
 * once the Japanese prompt has been read, and the next question only loads
 * once the English sentence has. Chrome drops `end` events often enough for
 * that to matter (backgrounding the tab mid-utterance is the easy way to
 * reproduce it), and without a cap a dropped event leaves the run frozen with
 * no way out but a reload. Ten seconds is well past the longest sentence in
 * the bank read at 0.88x, so a healthy utterance never hits this.
